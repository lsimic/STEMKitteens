# STEM Kitteens
Repository containing the files for the stem kitteens workshop

### Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of blender is recommended, but not required
Basic knowledge of python scripting is recommended, but not required

### Notes
You should follow the provided cookbook, but feel free to build upon the project later

This project assumes the use of blender 2.79, even though at the time of creation blender 2.80 beta exists.

That is because 2.79 is more stable, while the 2.80 has some UI tooltips missing, which mitigates it's ease of use and better UI for beginners in it's current state

### TODO list:
Create an english version of the cookbook

Add a section explaining commonly used blender tools in the cookbook
